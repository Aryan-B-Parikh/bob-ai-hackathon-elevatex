"""Integration test: IBM Bob → deterministic engine path → grounded answer.

Verifies that bob.respond() actually runs the engines (forecast, hotspot,
anomaly), returns a non-empty grounded answer, and exposes the tool-call
action list — confirming the MCP/engine pipeline is load-bearing, not
bypassed by a stale cache or short-circuit.

Requires PostgreSQL (skipped otherwise).
